        use useState, useEffect and useContext thoroughly to ensure my applications worked properly.
        This included keeping track of the score and time in my card game, knowing where a specific element
        is relative to the viewport to enable an animation and 
        knowing where the text was relative to the video
        to enable and disable overflow to hidden on the component

        An example of this is this component you're viewing right now. Both the tilting feature and animation can be toggled on and off by simply putting two props to false, and this list that you are viewing right now can be any form a text you want, you can put it into the customText prop to have customizable text or a regular p tag.`,

        factors in creating these dynamic interfaces, the text you are reading right now
        has been dynamically rendered itself. I have a great grasp
        of how to use conditionals in return statements and on style consts
        to rendering certain pieces based if another condition is true, like the 
        custom text, make a container of height 0 when it is not clicked on
        and height of 200 when clicked and much more.`,

        throughout my projects I learned how to use grid and flex layouts to display the cards properly
        in my card game, do responsive web, especially going from flex direction column for mobile
        and then row for desktop, and adding hover effects.\n\n This also includes advanced selectors like .class1 .class2 for
        precise element targeting and using the "id" tag
        to overwrite general css when a specific element needs specific editing`,
